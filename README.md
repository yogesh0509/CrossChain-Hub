# Introduction 

Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative force, promising decentralized and secure transactions across a myriad of applications. However, as the blockchain ecosystem continues to expand with various platforms and networks, a significant challenge has surfacedâ€”interoperability. Interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to seamlessly communicate, share data, and transact with one another. This challenge stems from the lack of standardized protocols and the diversity in blockchain architectures, consensus mechanisms, and smart contract languages. In essence, interoperability is crucial for unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology. Without effective interoperability, isolated blockchain networks operate as silos, limiting the fluid exchange of assets, information, and functionalities between them. The current absence of universally accepted standards and the presence of incompatible technical features hinder the creation of a unified and interconnected blockchain ecosystem.
This paper delves into the multifaceted problems associated with interoperability in blockchain. It explores the complexities arising from divergent consensus mechanisms, incompatible smart contract languages, and the absence of standardized communication protocols. The discussion aims at using the existing interoperable solutions to seamlessly call a contract that is deployed on a chain different than the caller of the contract. We aim to provide a user experience such that any contract that follows our guidelines can be easily connected across all Ethereum supported side-chains and layer 2 networks without the user worrying about it with the help of a simple API plugin. By addressing these
challenges head-on, we strive to contribute to the realization of a more connected, collaborative, and interoperable blockchain ecosystem.
